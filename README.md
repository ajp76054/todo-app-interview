# Angular TO-DO Interview Application


### Installed Libraries

For ease of use we have installed Bootstrap, and Angular Materials.

## Routes

#### API URL - https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

API URL is located in the `variables.ts` file and is already imported into the `todos.service.ts` file for you to consume.  The API accepts any of the following request types in the list.

 - GET	/todos
 - GET	/todos/1
 - POST	/todos
 - PUT	/todos/1
 - PATCH	/todos/1
 - DELETE	/todos/1

## Directions

- Create an interface to define the types for the attributes each todo that the API returns
- Use the todos service in the services folder to create methods for basic CRUD functions for our todos. (Reference the API list above as to what CRUD methods you should cover)
